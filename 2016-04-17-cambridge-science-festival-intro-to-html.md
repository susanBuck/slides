# HTML: The code behind web pages
* All web pages are made up of HTML
* Tour via View Source
* The role of CSS
* [MDN Element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=HTML%2FElement)


# Code Editors
* What is a code editor?
* Application: Sublime <http://sublimetext.com>
* Browser based: CodePen <http://codepen.io>
* Some benefits of a code editor
	* Line numbers
	* Syntax highlighting


# Tag basics
Tags are used to surround content, for example, here's a heading tag:

```html
<h1>Welcome to Susan's Web Site</h1>
```

The forward slash in the second tag indicates it's the **end tag**.

**Practice:** Add a heading and a subheading in the HTML panel of CodePen.





# Tag teamwork
Some tags work together with other tags.

An `<ul>` ([unordered list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)) tag teams up with `<li>` ([list item](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li)) tags

```html
Here are some of my favorite web sites:

<ul>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Women's Coding Collective</li>
  <li>Tumblr</li>
</ul>
```

**Practice:** Add a list of your three favorite websites below your headings.




# Links
Some start tags have **attributes** to describe information about that element.

Example, the `<a>` element ([anchors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) i.e., links) has the `href` attribute which dictates where a link should go.

```html
<a href='http://wikipedia.org'>The Free Encyclopedia</a>
```

`target` might specify a link should open in a new tab

```html
<a href='http://google.com' target='_blank'>The Free Encyclopedia</a>
```


**Practice:** Edit your unordered list so that each of your favorite web sites includes a link to that website.



# Images

Images have a `src` attribute to specify the image's location.

```html
<img src='kitten.png'>
```

The `alt` attribute is required for non-decorative images:

```html
<img src='kitten.png' alt='An adorable kitten'>
```


**Practice 1:** Find an image on Wikipedia of your favorite animal.

Right click on that image and find the option to copy the image URL.

* Chrome: *Copy Image URL*
* Firefox: *Copy Image Location*
* Safari: *Copy Image Address*

On your page, use this URL to display the image in an `<img>` element.

Example:

```html
<img alt='Adorable kitten' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Kitten_in_Rizal_Park%2C_Manila.jpg/340px-Kitten_in_Rizal_Park%2C_Manila.jpg'>
```

**Practice 2:** Using the letters from <http://lettergame.s3.amazonaws.com/details.html>, spell out your name on your page.


# Adding style

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS is a way to describe how the content on your page should look.

In the CSS Panel of CodePen, add the following CSS code:

```css
body {
	background-color:Orange;
	color:white;
}

h1 {
	font-family:Georgia;
}

img {
	border:1px solid black;
	padding:5px;
}
```

CSS is made up of `property:value` pairs assigned to HTML elements.

These `property:value` pairs are called **declarations**.

# Going live

Right now you're the only one that can view your web page&mdash; let's change that!

Web hosting gives you a place to store your work online, where the rest of the world can access it.

Example: [SiteGround](http://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=bf90ce97069361478ba4f2426b5f9d4d)

For this class, we'll use the free web site playground, [NeoCities](https://neocities.org).

1. Create an account at Neocities: <https://neocities.org>.
2. In Neocities, find the option to edit your `index.html` file.
3. In `index.html`, paste in the code you've created in this class.
4. View your finished product at `http://your-username.neocities.org`
