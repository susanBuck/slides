## Introduction
SEO is the process you go through to make your site show up higher in search engine results so your audience can find you.

[75% of users will never get past the first page of results](http://thewc.co/images/tasks/seo-search-results-ranked.png)

Deflating the hype: SEO Does not have to be a huge a undertaking.




## Search Engines
1. Google
2. Yahoo/Bing
3. Everyone else

Where are the rulebooks?

* [What Google tells us](https://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en/us/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf)
* Guesswork / observation




## How engines work
Crawler-based search engines

To see how Google has indexed your (or any) site, do a google search, prefixing it with `site:` (no space)

Example:

`site:flybellaballoons.com`

## Title Element

`<title>`

* In head of your HTML document; describes the content of the page
* Google uses the title for context and to label your results

```html
<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/seo-title-tag.png'>
```

* Use different titles for different pages - don't just repeat across your site
* Be descriptive yet concise; you have about **60-70 characters** to convey your message.
* Incorporate keywords you want people to use to find you.
* Don't waste space: "Official website", "very", "best", "really"
* Whether you include your name / company name depends on your audience target

## Meta tags

* Also in the head of the your document
* Never displayed on the page
* There are different meta tags, including description:

```html
<meta name="description" content="Bella Balloons provides Ohio Hot Air Balloon Rides, Cincinnati Hot Air Balloon Rides, and Dayton Hot Air Balloon Rides.">
````

* Usually the summary listed under your headline in search results
* Have about **130-155 characters** to work with
* Use different descriptions for each page, be descriptive yet concise, incorporate keywords
* Short descriptions can easily get lost, so always aim for two lines of text
* Occasionally search engines will override your description
* Search terms found in your description will be bolded in results
* Keywords meta tag is no longer used




## Headings
* Heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) - not just for styling
* Clue to search engine what your site is about
* Like title and meta tags, you want to be sure your headings include relevant keywords where necessary




## Links
<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/seo-good-bad-links.png'>

* Don't say "Click here"&mdash; waste of link power 
* Links are how Google bots crawl through your site
* Google pays a lot of attention to anchor text
* [Remove `www` from URLs](https://gist.github.com/susanBuck/9240424)




## Images
* Use alt attributes for all your non-decorative images.
* Use descriptive file names: `logo4.jpg` vs. `bella-balloons-logo.jpg`
